VARIABLES:
    POPULATION_SIZE ->  
    Genes           ->  string of all characters to be used
    Target          ->  the target string/sucessful-generation
                        to create 

FUNCTIONS:
    mutated_genes   ->  to pick and return a random signle character/gene 
                        from the 'Genes' string variable.
    create_genome   ->  calling the "mutated_genes" function for n amount 
                        of times where n is the length of the 'Target' 
                        string variable.
    mate            -> 

STEPS OF EXECUTION:
    1.  CREATE INITIAL GENERATIONâ†´
            crating 100(POPULATION_SIZE) amount of chromosome
            where each chromosome/individual contains 22(len(TARGET))
            genomes randomly picked from the 'GENES' string variable
    2.  
            
NOTES:
    -   one chromosome is equal to one population and its a 
        string with the length of the 'TARGET' variable,
        and if the population is 100, then that means 
        there is 100 chromosomes.

    -   the 'TARGET' string variable represents the 
        succesfull individual

    -   i think an individual, a chromosome and 
        a single population is the same thing

    -   genes                       : abcdefg1234!@#$...
        one gnome                   : 'a' or 'b' or '1' or '#'
        three gnomes                : 'abc' or '123' or 'a2$'
        chromosome(one population)  : 'Ay2O9lc-:r4:ozq1eAY2-q' 
        five population             : # basically 5 chromosomes
        target chromosome           : 'Artivicial intelegence'

TO-DO DRAFT:
    -   can string be counted like an array? 
        make a string variable, and do a len() function to it.
